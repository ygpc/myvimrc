my .vimrc to make vim more comfortable for me and someone?

many part of this is from quiita and costomize for me.

put .vimrc in your user directory and run vim.You may be able to  use rich vim.

Notice:discription around  'NeoBundle' should be deleted at first.
if you have no 'NeoBundle' ,you may be cause vim error.
